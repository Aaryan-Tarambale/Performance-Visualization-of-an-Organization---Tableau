**Performance Overview Dashboard**

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to summarize key business performance metrics. The project focuses on presenting sales trends, customer activity, profitability, and cost distribution in a clear, structured format.

**Project Description**

The dashboard visualizes data across several operational areas to provide a concise overview of overall performance. It includes top-level KPIs, quarterly sales and cost trends, profitability ratios, customer segment contribution, and detailed cost breakdowns. The goal of the project is to demonstrate effective dashboard design and the ability to communicate insights through clear visual structure.

The repository includes the Tableau workbook, a sample dataset, and a screenshot of the final dashboard layout.

**Results and Findings**

The dashboard highlights several observations derived from the dataset:
1. Sales total approximately 1.2M across the time period, with notable fluctuations visible in the trend lines.
2. Orders and customer counts follow similar patterns, suggesting seasonal or campaign-driven variations.
3. Profitability indicators reflect moderate margins, with Gross Profit Margin at 26 percent and Operating Profit Margin at 12 percent.
4. Customer segments contribute unevenly, with the Consumer segment accounting for the largest share.
5. Operational costs represent the highest expense category, followed by product and marketing costs.
6. Quarter-to-quarter comparison shows identifiable peaks in net performance and outliers in both sales and cost trends.

These findings offer a clear, consolidated view of business performance, designed to support management in making informed strategic decisions.
